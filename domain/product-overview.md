# InMoney Product Overview

## What is InMoney?

**InMoney** is an options trading intelligence platform that helps investors see what "smart money" (institutional traders, hedge funds) is doing in the options market.

**Tagline**: *"Re-Align Risk & Reward For Investors"*

## The Problem We Solve

Options trading is complex. Every day, billions of dollars flow through options markets, but:

- **Retail investors are blind** - They can't easily see unusual trading activity that might signal upcoming price moves
- **Strategy creation is hard** - Building options strategies requires understanding Greeks, expiration dates, strike prices, etc.
- **Data is scattered** - Traders need multiple tools to track earnings, news, and market sentiment

### The Gap We Fill

InMoney bridges the gap between raw market data and actionable investment insights by combining real-time options flow data with AI-powered analysis tools.
